README: Why all this code ?
=============================

Intentions
-------------
* Learn about process creation 
* Address space
* Inter process communication 

Actual task
------------
* Share simple data between two processes.
* And later extend it to understand other things
 	
Modules 
------------
I have separated the common ways of doing this various folders.
	* forks
		- Figure out ways we could create child processes and their implications 
	* pipes 
		- Get the data passed 	
	* sockets 
		- Get the data across between two processes using sockets. 	

Helpful things
