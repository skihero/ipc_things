Forking and things

 Forking has a bunch of consequences that are explained in the man pages. 

 Note: Under Linux fork() is implemented using copy-on-write pages, 
        as a effect it duplicates the parent's page tables and creates a unique task structure for
	the child. This may be different from the unix designs 

	
VFork 
 Considered to be dangerous for serious things. 
  It is used to create new processes without copying the page tables of the parent process.
  It may be useful in performance-sensitive applications where  a  child  is created 
	which then immediately issues an execve(2).
